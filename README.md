# Sensor Fault Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting and classifying faults in sensor data using **Machine Learning techniques**.  
Sensor faults such as drift, bias, stuck-at, or random failures can lead to incorrect decisions in industrial and IoT systems.  
Our ML-based approach ensures **accuracy, reliability, and safety** by identifying faulty sensor readings automatically.

 Features
- Preprocessing of raw sensor data (handling missing values & noise)
- Feature engineering (statistical, temporal, and correlation-based features)
- Machine Learning models for fault detection and classification
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Scalable for IoT, industrial, healthcare, and automotive applications

 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models:** Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
